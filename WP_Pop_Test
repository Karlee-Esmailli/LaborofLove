=== Q1W2_MON_JJWPIntro

Last night at 11:30pm, Jaxon sent me a calendar invite for a 1:1 meeting, bright and early. No agenda attached. What’s this about? I feel shivers of fear down my spine. Best case scenario: he’s quitting his job due to a deadly disease he has contracted. Worst case scenario: he wants me to rub his feet. 

// BG: Meeting Room, Jaxon and Judith sprites 

Rosie: Morning! Ahh, Judith, happy to see that you’re joining us. 

Jaxon: Hey, kiddo. 

Judith: Good morning, Rosie. Take a seat. 

Jaxon: Now that we’ve finished all the onboarding bullshit, we can actually have you start doing your job. Finally! 

Rosie: I know, right? I’m eager to get into the weeds. 

Jaxon: And get into the weeds you shall. But Judith insisted that we give you a “high level” blah blah blah so you know what is “expected.” 

Rosie: Ahh, I see. We’re here to discuss performance metrics. 

Judith: …Yes. And I know that work evaluation isn’t the most exciting thing in the world, but keeping things standardized is how we ensure fair treatment across all employees. 

Judith airdrops me a massive spreadsheet, entitled: Cognos Product Lead Performance Evaluation Metrics. 

Judith: You’ll see that all of your responsibilities are listed here. At the end of the quarter, we’ll conduct your overall Performance Review. I’m sure you’ve seen this kind of 5-point scale before. One means “Unacceptable,” Two means “Needs Improvement,” Three is “Meets Expectations,” Four and Five are “Exceeds Expectations” and “Outstanding.” 

// Non-Diegetic Pop-Up: 
At the end of every quarter, you’ll attend your PERFORMANCE REVIEW. Level up your WORK PERFORMANCE to succeed! 

// The Work Performance progress bar should be split into five sections: (5– Outstanding, 4– Exceeds Expectations, 3- Meets Expectations, 2- Needs Improvement, 1- Unacceptable)
// 

Jaxon: Since I’m the one who’s working with you most intimately on the day-to-day, I’ll be grading the skills that have to do with your team performance. 

Judith: And I’ll be evaluating your generalized Product Lead responsibilities. 

Rosie: Understood! So I’ll have to achieve these standards to meet expectations… It’s great that this is outlined so clearly. 

Jaxon: Rosie. Stop looking at the spreadsheet. Look at me. 

I turn my gaze towards his beady pig eyes. My hatred burns. Should I fuck this guy’s wife? 

Jaxon: You’re gonna do more than MEET expectations. I wanna see FOURS and FIVES across the board. Got it? I&A doesn’t fuck with threes. 

Judith: I agree. You’ve got too much potential to aim for the middle of the pack. 

Judith: Any questions? Does this all make sense? 

So they’re expecting me to exceed their expectations? I love how much sense it makes. It makes SO MUCH SENSE!!!!!!!! 

Rosie: Crystal clear! Thanks for walking me through it. I’ll get started exceeding!!
